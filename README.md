# Responsive Navigation Menu

## Overview

This project is a responsive navigation menu built with Vite + React. It features a hamburger menu for mobile viewports, animated transitions that hover and highlight the buttons, and client-side routing using React Router.

This is a Visual Graphic online bookstore website named visbook.

## Features

- Responsive navigation bar
- Hamburger menu for small screens
- Smooth CSS animations for menu transitions
- React Router for client-side navigation
- JSON-based product data loading for book covers and information (book titles, subtitles, authors, prices, etc.)
- Book covers scrollable using navigation buttons
- Images are stored inside the `public` folder, not inside `src`, to simplify asset management and referencing in production builds.

## Setup Instructions

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Set up the project using Vite and install React along with React Router DOM.

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate into the project directory and run:

   npm create vite@latest

   Select the React template.

3. Install dependencies:

   npm install react-router-dom
   npm install
 
4. Start the development server with:

   npm run dev


### Deploy to GitHub Pages

To deploy the site to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Install the `gh-pages` package:

   npm install gh-pages --save-dev


2. Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```

3. Run the deployment command:

   npm run deploy


### Important for GitHub Pages Routing

If running on GitHub Pages, **replace** `BrowserRouter` with `HashRouter` in your React Router setup:

```js
import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';


#### Why use HashRouter?

GitHub Pages serves static files and does not support server-side routing, which causes `BrowserRouter` to fail with 404 errors on page reloads or direct URL access.

`HashRouter` uses the URL hash (`#`) portion to simulate routing entirely on the client side, preventing 404 errors by keeping the URL path consistent from the server's perspective.

## Technologies Used

- Vite
- React
- React Router DOM
- CSS3

## Key Concepts and Hooks Used

- `useState` and `useEffect` from React
- `useRef` and `useNavigate` for scrolling book covers horizontally (left and right)
- `localStorage.getItem()` for retrieving persisted data
- `JSON.parse()` for parsing external JSON files
- HashRouter as Router

## Accessibility Considerations

- Clear focus states
- Keyboard navigation for menu
- Responsive layout across devices
